I believe that starting therapy takes courage; it shows that a person wants more for themselves, their relationship, and their partner. You may have struggled with expressing your needs or advocating for yourself in the past – I can help you understand your needs more and learn to set boundaries when stress feels unbearable.If you feel disconnected from yourself or your partner, I will guide you towards establishing a deeper connection and level of understanding. I work with clients that want to dig deeper into the core of who they are in order to live their lives more authentically.I lead with gentle guidance and an understanding of the courage and vulnerability it takes to come to therapy. I hope to guide you on your journey towards self-love and compassion. I have experience working with couples and individuals of all identities and backgrounds.

      "Over the last two decades my clientele has changed along with my experience, skill acquisition and personal life.  First as a clinician, then business owner, family man and student of life and living, I have been fortunate to have a career that reflects my own life.  Peek moments, so many blessings, long trials and struggles and big losses have rounded the edges of once sharp ideals and brought a humble gratitude for the souls I've met in my office.  While I  have a solid grasp of several powerful treatment modalities, my goal first is to be a good human to those who seek me out.  I'm a source of grounding and direction for those in crisis/process.  I work with those who are burdened by the responsibility of being in service of others, the passion they followed and were betrayed by.  I enjoy working with those who confuse 'selflessness' with total sacrifice of the 'self'.  I work with those with a strong work ethic and big hearts.If you are reading this, I'm going to assume your'e, at the same time, resourceful and, a bit lost in life.  I've been there.  We both still have a lot to learn.  I know you're taking a big risk on top of everything else that's going on with you and yours...that's how healing begins.  Thanks for considering what's best for you.  Lee"

You may be asking yourself: “Will anyone understand?” Or even: “Could anyone accept me if they really knew?” It's so important that you know that you are not alone. Though the particularities of your experiences are uniquely yours, this human life is full of complex pain and sorrows just like what you are struggling with now. It is possible to find a way. Through curious exploration, you may develop a deeper understanding of your internal processes and how you got here.My style is collaborative, relational, and strengths-based. It is important to me that you feel accepted, heard, and understood in your experience.

I believe that any symptoms or behaviors currently bothering you served a purpose at one time; if they have ceased to be useful, together we can find ways to reduce or eliminate them. I draw most heavily from somatic, cognitive-behavioral, narrative and solution-focused therapies. I specialize in brief, focused work but can engage in longer term work, if this is more appropriate for your concerns.My specialties are: Trauma, Sexual Violence, Domestic Violence, Anxiety & Depression, and Sexuality. I offer a welcoming, supportive therapeutic environment for adolescents, adults and couples of all genders and sexualities. Together, we can make sense of your experiences and discover what might help you to move forward.I've worked in mental health for more than 15 years: as a hotline volunteer, advocate, family educator, crisis counselor and psychotherapist. I've worked in schools, rape crisis centers, shelters, and family service agencies. I've offered training in sexual violence treatment, PTSD, secondary trauma, and work-life balance."

      "I believe that each one of us has a genuine need to feel valued and connected. I also believe that connection is the foundation in our lives.  We all need to find our purpose and find a place where we can belong to something bigger than ourselves. Sometimes our inability to connect with others can leave us feeling empty, hopeless or insecure. It can cause us to isolate, tolerate unhealthy relationships, abuse substances or lose our direction. When we learn to build healthy connections and find our purpose, we are more likely to experience hope and fulfillment. I am a licensed clinical social worker with 30+ years of experience.Many of my clients struggle with relationships, life transitions, feelings of isolation, school demands, perfectionism, career decisions, parenting, body image, depression, anxiety, family issues, trauma, sexual orientation,  and suicidal ideation. I am trained in Attachment Focused EMDR which helps people who have experienced any type of life trauma.Therapy takes courage and strength.  We all struggle at times and deserve to feel heard and understood.  I strive to create a safe, comfortable environment where trust and connection are the foundation of the therapeutic relationship. I respect each client's story and process in order to support change."

Self doubt, lack of confidence, stuck-ness, and living through challenging daily symptoms and stressors can make it hard to access authenticity, zestfulness and your life's full potential. You are capable of healing, shifting and integrating negative experiences into something that can launch you forward and bring wisdom. I offer warm presence, encouraging easeful participation and inviting your creative spirit. You can unlock, embrace and expand your personal capacity for growth, authenticity, innovation, self-expression and positive impact.I bring playful curiosity and serve as a motivated witness. I encourage slow and steady sensing into connection of mind, body and soul. My intention is to help recognize and release attachment to relentless/unwanted thoughts, feelings and behaviors to make space for energetic aliveness. Movement and creative flow can help make sense of your inner world.I utilize an integrative therapeutic approach, including expressive arts interventions, somatic awareness, systems theories and existential influence. I have experience with youth/teens, young adults, parents, and those wanting to start a family. I am here as a witness to your own authentic revelations, readiness for healing, shifting and empowerment."

My goal as a therapist is to help you in this process. We will work on identifying what you are experiencing, how you got there, where you want to go and what you need to achieve your goals. I strive to be both a focused listener and active participant in sessions, and to create a safe space where clients feel understood and respected. Through the therapy process, we develop a relationship that has the potential to be transformative and healing.  I am a therapist, supervisor, administrator and activist with extensive training in a variety of therapeutic approaches.  I've worked with teens, adults, couples and families for over 25 years in New York, San Francisco and the Sacramento/Davis region.As a Syrian-American and first-generation college student, I developed a passion for social change and educational reform. Through EMERGE (www.emergecenter4sel.org), I am working to expand the quality, range and accessibility of services for young people and other marginalized populations, such as people of color and LGBTQ individuals."

I work with adults (18+) who are struggling with depression, anxiety, relationship problems, university challenges, both academic and social, and other difficult life events/transitions. My goal is to establish a positive and trusting connection with my clients while providing a supportive environment for the work we do together. I work collaboratively with my clients to find new ways of coping and managing difficult challenges that will ultimately lead to a more meaningful and productive life.In my practice I value having an integrative therapeutic approach to working with my clients. My perspective is primarily solution-focused and strengths-based while mostly utilizing cognitive-behavioral and mindfulness-based techniques. Having flexibility allows me to better meet the needs of my clients and their own unique situation.I have 30 plus years of experience providing counseling, case management, and consultation to clients and various agencies. My professional experiences prepared me well for the work I do as a therapist in private practice. I enjoy working with adults of all ages, including university students who are struggling with academic and social/relationship issues."

      "My psychotherapy practice is built around helping people create significant changes in the way they are able to live their lives. Those who have been challenged by the experience of becoming parents of a difficult child, those who have had their lives disrupted by trauma, those struggling with food issues, and those who desire to deepen their understanding of themselves are among the people who will find a welcoming space in my office to slow down and reflect. I believe that living a mindful and aware life is a true blessing.In addition to a psychodynamic focus to help you on your journey of internal understanding and healing, I use mindfulness, hypnosis, and behavioral techniques to transform intense and painful emotions and use EMDR to assist healing from trauma.I enjoy working with parents and young children to help them create a more rewarding family life in which all can thrive. Children (and some adults) love my sand tray as a way to express and understand their inner life non-verbally.\nI look forward to hearing from you."

He is board-certified in addictions and co-morbidity; teenagers, adults, and the elderly; and high-acuity clients with anxiety, depression, and trauma. Justin specializes in understanding unconscious maladaptive thinking and behaviors that lead to depression and anxiety. He helps adults discover and discard old, unhelpful patterns and learn to integrate new ways of thinking and behaving. Justin utilizes psychodynamic, cognitive behavioral, and existential concepts.He believes we all have the capacity to expand when we obtain momentum in a healthy direction. Understanding other cultures and people pulls us closer to understanding commonalities, new perspectives, and concepts to feel increasingly empowered. He also believes dancing can be the ultimate liberation for the spirit."

      "As my client, you will have my full commitment to listen carefully to your concerns and explore options that are attainable and will bring meaningful experiences to your life. In the immediacy of our hour together, there will be the opportunity to deepen the connection to yourself and to those who are important to you. Our therapeutic work increases self-awareness which in turn enhances your ability to live authentically and relationally. I am trained in EMDR when this modality is needed to diminish traumatic injury.I specialize in Emotionally Focused Couples Therapy (EFT). If you are my clients, we work together to identify patterns sourced in old emotional injuries that block feelings of caring and intimacy. Through deepening self-awarenss, negative patterns are incrementally replaced by positive ones. These include experiencing a loving acceptance of yourself and of your partner."

      "Do you feel over sensitive or misunderstood, or that patterns keep repeating in your life?  Therapy is a unique experience that gets under the patterns to see why and how they got you into a negative space-and then to help get unstuck. Working through your experience of loss can help make sense of the depression or anxiety that are taking too much or your time and energy.   That unlocks the natural development of healthy self esteem. Therapy helps you reclaim yourself from the 'unfinished business' of life stresses.  Please inquire through email LauraShlien@gmail.com, as calls from this site may get lost and I want to respond to youHow this works; as you explain what is stopping your from moving forward, we can illuminate not only the patterns but also a time of life or vivid experience when those patterns developed. With insightful compassion comes the ability to reassemble your reactions to stressors.  That creates positive change.There are real techniques to push back at intrusive and negative self talk.  There is real evidence that  a change in perspective brings a change in outcomes.  The past won't alter but the presents belongs to you. Change is hard but both necessary and possible.  I am meeting with people by a HIPPA secure telehealth program, and clients find this really works"
