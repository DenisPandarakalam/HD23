I believe that starting therapy takes courage; it shows that a person wants more for themselves, their relationship, and their partner. You may have struggled with expressing your needs or advocating for yourself in the past – I can help you understand your needs more and learn to set boundaries when stress feels unbearable.If you feel disconnected from yourself or your partner, I will guide you towards establishing a deeper connection and level of understanding. I work with clients that want to dig deeper into the core of who they are in order to live their lives more authentically.I lead with gentle guidance and an understanding of the courage and vulnerability it takes to come to therapy. I hope to guide you on your journey towards self-love and compassion. I have experience working with couples and individuals of all identities and backgrounds.

      "Over the last two decades my clientele has changed along with my experience, skill acquisition and personal life.  First as a clinician, then business owner, family man and student of life and living, I have been fortunate to have a career that reflects my own life.  Peek moments, so many blessings, long trials and struggles and big losses have rounded the edges of once sharp ideals and brought a humble gratitude for the souls I've met in my office.  While I  have a solid grasp of several powerful treatment modalities, my goal first is to be a good human to those who seek me out.  I'm a source of grounding and direction for those in crisis/process.  I work with those who are burdened by the responsibility of being in service of others, the passion they followed and were betrayed by.  I enjoy working with those who confuse 'selflessness' with total sacrifice of the 'self'.  I work with those with a strong work ethic and big hearts.If you are reading this, I'm going to assume your'e, at the same time, resourceful and, a bit lost in life.  I've been there.  We both still have a lot to learn.  I know you're taking a big risk on top of everything else that's going on with you and yours...that's how healing begins.  Thanks for considering what's best for you.  Lee"

I can provide psychological evaluations when needed to help identify areas of difficulty and of strength, and to guide treatment direction. I also provide psychotherapy to children, adolescents and their families.While working from an attachment perspective and a relational focus, I also incorporate strategies from treatment modalities such as cognitive behavioral therapy and family therapy that have proven effective in addressing certain symptoms.As parents are central to their children's lives, it is important to me to involve parents actively in their child's treatment while at the same time maintaining the privacy needed by some adolescents in order to progress in treatment."

You may be asking yourself: “Will anyone understand?” Or even: “Could anyone accept me if they really knew?” It's so important that you know that you are not alone. Though the particularities of your experiences are uniquely yours, this human life is full of complex pain and sorrows just like what you are struggling with now. It is possible to find a way. Through curious exploration, you may develop a deeper understanding of your internal processes and how you got here.My style is collaborative, relational, and strengths-based. It is important to me that you feel accepted, heard, and understood in your experience. My hope is to support you in gaining the insight, skills, courage, and confidence to take steps toward healing and more fulfillment in your life.Finding the right fit with a therapist is critical.

I draw most heavily from somatic, cognitive-behavioral, narrative and solution-focused therapies. I specialize in brief, focused work but can engage in longer term work, if this is more appropriate for your concerns.My specialties are: Trauma, Sexual Violence, Domestic Violence, Anxiety & Depression, and Sexuality. I offer a welcoming, supportive therapeutic environment for adolescents, adults and couples of all genders and sexualities. Together, we can make sense of your experiences and discover what might help you to move forward.I've worked in mental health for more than 15 years: as a hotline volunteer, advocate, family educator, crisis counselor and psychotherapist. I've worked in schools, rape crisis centers, shelters, and family service agencies. I've offered training in sexual violence treatment, PTSD, secondary trauma, and work-life balance."

      "I believe that each one of us has a genuine need to feel valued and connected. I also believe that connection is the foundation in our lives.  We all need to find our purpose and find a place where we can belong to something bigger than ourselves. Sometimes our inability to connect with others can leave us feeling empty, hopeless or insecure. It can cause us to isolate, tolerate unhealthy relationships, abuse substances or lose our direction. When we learn to build healthy connections and find our purpose, we are more likely to experience hope and fulfillment. I am a licensed clinical social worker with 30+ years of experience.Many of my clients struggle with relationships, life transitions, feelings of isolation, school demands, perfectionism, career decisions, parenting, body image, depression, anxiety, family issues, trauma, sexual orientation,  and suicidal ideation. I am trained in Attachment Focused EMDR which helps people who have experienced any type of life trauma.Therapy takes courage and strength.  We all struggle at times and deserve to feel heard and understood.  I strive to create a safe, comfortable environment where trust and connection are the foundation of the therapeutic relationship. I respect each client's story and process in order to support change."

I encourage slow and steady sensing into connection of mind, body and soul. My intention is to help recognize and release attachment to relentless/unwanted thoughts, feelings and behaviors to make space for energetic aliveness. Movement and creative flow can help make sense of your inner world.I utilize an integrative therapeutic approach, including expressive arts interventions, somatic awareness, systems theories and existential influence.

My goal as a therapist is to help you in this process. We will work on identifying what you are experiencing, how you got there, where you want to go and what you need to achieve your goals. I strive to be both a focused listener and active participant in sessions, and to create a safe space where clients feel understood and respected. Through the therapy process, we develop a relationship that has the potential to be transformative and healing.  I am a therapist, supervisor, administrator and activist with extensive training in a variety of therapeutic approaches.  I've worked with teens, adults, couples and families for over 25 years in New York, San Francisco and the Sacramento/Davis region.As a Syrian-American and first-generation college student, I developed a passion for social change and educational reform.

I work with adults (18+) who are struggling with depression, anxiety, relationship problems, university challenges, both academic and social, and other difficult life events/transitions. My goal is to establish a positive and trusting connection with my clients while providing a supportive environment for the work we do together. I work collaboratively with my clients to find new ways of coping and managing difficult challenges that will ultimately lead to a more meaningful and productive life.In my practice I value having an integrative therapeutic approach to working with my clients. My perspective is primarily solution-focused and strengths-based while mostly utilizing cognitive-behavioral and mindfulness-based techniques. Having flexibility allows me to better meet the needs of my clients and their own unique situation.I have 30 plus years of experience providing counseling, case management, and consultation to clients and various agencies. My professional experiences prepared me well for the work I do as a therapist in private practice. I enjoy working with adults of all ages, including university students who are struggling with academic and social/relationship issues."

      "My psychotherapy practice is built around helping people create significant changes in the way they are able to live their lives. Those who have been challenged by the experience of becoming parents of a difficult child, those who have had their lives disrupted by trauma, those struggling with food issues, and those who desire to deepen their understanding of themselves are among the people who will find a welcoming space in my office to slow down and reflect. I believe that living a mindful and aware life is a true blessing.In addition to a psychodynamic focus to help you on your journey of internal understanding and healing, I use mindfulness, hypnosis, and behavioral techniques to transform intense and painful emotions and use EMDR to assist healing from trauma.I enjoy working with parents and young children to help them create a more rewarding family life in which all can thrive. Children (and some adults) love my sand tray as a way to express and understand their inner life non-verbally.\nI look forward to hearing from you."

He is board-certified in addictions and co-morbidity; teenagers, adults, and the elderly; and high-acuity clients with anxiety, depression, and trauma. Justin specializes in understanding unconscious maladaptive thinking and behaviors that lead to depression and anxiety. He helps adults discover and discard old, unhelpful patterns and learn to integrate new ways of thinking and behaving. Justin utilizes psychodynamic, cognitive behavioral, and existential concepts.He believes we all have the capacity to expand when we obtain momentum in a healthy direction. Understanding other cultures and people pulls us closer to understanding commonalities, new perspectives, and concepts to feel increasingly empowered. He also believes dancing can be the ultimate liberation for the spirit."

In the immediacy of our hour together, there will be the opportunity to deepen the connection to yourself and to those who are important to you. Our therapeutic work increases self-awareness which in turn enhances your ability to live authentically and relationally. I am trained in EMDR when this modality is needed to diminish traumatic injury.I specialize in Emotionally Focused Couples Therapy (EFT). If you are my clients, we work together to identify patterns sourced in old emotional injuries that block feelings of caring and intimacy. Through deepening self-awarenss, negative patterns are incrementally replaced by positive ones. These include experiencing a loving acceptance of yourself and of your partner."

      "Do you feel over sensitive or misunderstood, or that patterns keep repeating in your life?  Therapy is a unique experience that gets under the patterns to see why and how they got you into a negative space-and then to help get unstuck. Working through your experience of loss can help make sense of the depression or anxiety that are taking too much or your time and energy.   That unlocks the natural development of healthy self esteem. Therapy helps you reclaim yourself from the 'unfinished business' of life stresses.  Please inquire through email LauraShlien@gmail.com, as calls from this site may get lost and I want to respond to youHow this works; as you explain what is stopping your from moving forward, we can illuminate not only the patterns but also a time of life or vivid experience when those patterns developed. With insightful compassion comes the ability to reassemble your reactions to stressors.  That creates positive change.There are real techniques to push back at intrusive and negative self talk.  There is real evidence that  a change in perspective brings a change in outcomes.  The past won't alter but the presents belongs to you. Change is hard but both necessary and possible.  I am meeting with people by a HIPPA secure telehealth program, and clients find this really works"

I am here to hold space for you as we make our way through this existential crisis.Effective therapy must involve both mind and body. When we pay attention to our bodies we can begin to untangle places where we are emotionally or cognitively stuck. Working somatically will create space for profound growth that is often untapped using only traditional therapy modalities.In addition to traditional talk therapy, I utilize Somatic Experiencing, meditation, relaxation, movement, and mindfulness techniques in my practice. I have additional training in helping clients integrate non-ordinary states of consciousness."

      "I believe that people experience healing in and through relationships. Brené Brown defines connection as “the energy that exists between people when they feel seen, heard, and valued; when they derive sustenance and strength from the relationship”. Therapy can be a powerful, safe space to experience that connection both as individuals and partnerships.As both a couples and individual therapist I practice emotion-focused therapy (EFT) with influences from both attachment and family system theories.  Additionally, I am a certified Integrated Intimacy Professional; I specialize in bringing a holistic focus to helping couples work through sex and intimacy issues.I offer a free 20 minute phone consultation for prospective clients to see if therapy with me feels like a good fit. I am currently only accepting new clients via Teletherapy due to COVID-19. I am a licensed MFT in Washington state and a licensed MFT associate in California and happily work with clients from both areas."

      "A favorite quote of mine is, \"The truth always happens.\" Too often, our present truth is filled with suffering and anxiety. But we can shape our truth, to better cope with disorder or overcome pain and trauma. The therapeutic process provides insight into behaviors and actions that allows for growth in self and relationships.  I specialize in working with children, adolescents and adults of all backgrounds, helping clients and families to understand a range of behaviors and disorders. Working together, clients learn to recognize feelings, relate them to behaviors, and develop tools to recreate their own truth.I have a youthful spirit and am open and honest with my clients, always working to provide an environment conducive for growth. I offer a sliding payment scale, so that clients can afford the help they deserve."

      "Are stressors, challenges, or unresolved issues from your past holding you back and causing strain in your relationships? Are you seeking compassionate, client-focused therapy in an atmosphere of unconditional acceptance? I understand that each individual's story is unique, and so are their responses to life's challenges. I specialize in working with individuals (adult and teen) and couples regardless of background, who are navigating the complexities of depression, anxiety, trauma and PTSD, strained relationships, intimacy difficulties, and infidelity.Grounded in trauma-informed therapy techniques that incorporate somatic and mindfulness practices, my goal is to help you tackle underlying causes of your struggles and integrate strategies to maintain your emotional and psychological well-being. I primarily use attachment theory combined with evidence-based approaches such as IFS, EFT and Narrative Therapy.I understand that your journey is unique, and I am committed to walking alongside you every step of the way. If you're prepared and motivated to embark on a transformative quest toward healing, self-discovery, and stronger relationships, let's work together.    Are you ready? You don’t have to navigate this journey alone."

Whether you are struggling with maneuvering through obstacles, going through major life transitions or are trying to learn how to handle anxious and depressive symptoms all are welcome here. If you are motivated, self aware, cognizant of your feelings, open minded, hesitant, scared, uncertain, confused and overwhelmed then therapy is the place for you. I offer both in person and Telehealth sessions and have a range of availability!If you are a student then the cost per session is $30.Helping people with their mental health and breaking both the societal and cultural stigma surrounding it has always been something I was passionate about. Therapy is a place where you are at your most vulnerable and I’d be honored to be allowed into that space of vulnerability alongside you so that I can assist you in accomplishing your goals."

      "I enjoy working with clients who are experiencing roadblocks on their path to a more fulfilled life. Barriers to wellness are not limited to the mental realm and may include physical issues, sexual issues, relationship issues and spiritual issues. These issues interrelate and thus must all be addressed holistically. The symptom is not the cause and is often key in figuring out where the problem resides. I believe in the power of the human beings to heal themselves. I see my role as helping identify solutions and offering tools for personal growth and healing. I seek to empower my clients as they heal, grow and develop resilience.My main approaches are Reality Therapy and Naturopathic Psychotherapy, a holistic form of psychotherapy evaluating the interrelatedness of the mental, physical and spiritual realms. In addition to being a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist, I have a master's degree in Psychology and a doctorate in Naturopathy for Health Care Professionals.For over 20 years, I've been providing a wide range of psychotherapy services to adults, teens and couples in a safe, warm and confidential environment. My practice is designed to support you on your journey of healing and growth. Additionally, I specialize in working with alternative lifestyle communities, including the polyamorous and BDSM communities."

      "Do you sometimes feel alone in your pain, or worry that no one really understands you?  It's not easy navigating the demands of life including family, relationships and work. Expressing yourself is difficult when you can't find the right words to say. Having to feel like you have to be the strong one every moment of the day is exhausting, or the one that holds it together for everybody. It can take a toll on your mind and body. You can be your own worst critic although you try your best to do everything right.You're needing support with the self critic, the negative thoughts, and comparing yourself to others. Imagine being able to calm those anxious thoughts and be in the present moment as well as connect with your body. You have the ability to take control and learn how to offer yourself tools that will help you connect to your authentic self.It is important to make sure that you feel comfortable and safe in therapy. And once you feel these things, you can open up, without feeling judged or criticized. This allows you the ability to change, grow and heal by being heard and seen unconditionally and authentically. I welcome you to reach out if you feel that we may be a good fit."

      "I believe that therapy can be a rewarding and life-changing experience. I became a therapist to help people lead happier, more productive lives. Clients need a sense of connection and trust, but also need someone who will gently challenge long-standing beliefs and patterns in a way that leads to positive change. I have been a therapist in the Davis community for 20 years, and have extensive training in Biofeedback, Neurofeedback, Coherence therapy, and Long term psychodynamic psychotherapy.Neuroscience research has demonstrated that conditions such as depression, anxiety, PTSD, ADD, and more have brain signatures that can be seen with brain mapping procedures. Once mapped, using auditory feedback and visual feedback, I can effectively retrain and normalize brainwave signatures resulting in symptom relief and increased well-being.I am particularly interested in Optimal Performance Training. I integrate biofeedback, neurofeedback, and talk therapy to help people perform at their optimal capability. This includes athletics as well as any endeavor which requires high level functioning."

It can often be helpful to talk though some of the issues we are struggling with in a therapeutic relationship that feels understanding, safe, and compassionate.  Human beings aren't meant to \"go it alone\".  In fact, feeling alone is inherently traumatizing itself.  I have been licensed for over 20 years, working with individuals, couples, and families to heal their relationships, and to overcome trauma, depression, and addictions.My approach is humanistic, attachment focused, and relational. I don't believe I have the answers to your problems, but can work with you to discover those answers for yourself.  My experience includes working with step-families and LGBT clients.  I have been trained in EMDR and Emotionally Focused Couples Therapy (EFT).I have taught in the University of Phoenix Masters of Counseling program and currently provide supervision and consultation to other therapists.

      "Are you tired of struggling with your mental wellness on your own? We all have ups and downs in our lives. But wouldn't it be great to feel a reassuring undercurrent of serenity and resilience, no matter what is happening in your outer world? What you want is equanimity, and the way to get there is by turning your focus inward, and embodying the courageous leader of your own internal family of mind parts.  Along the way, you will rediscover your innate capacity for awareness, creativity, and compassion.As your therapist, I take the time to research, test, distill, and integrate ancient wisdom with modern neuroscience for treating psychic  and  psycho-physiological imbalances of all types in a sustainable way. Allow me to help you experience the freedom and possibilities of a clear mind."

Additionally, I have spent years in schools providing guidance in the IEP/special education process and helping children of all ages needing assistance to achieve academic success.  I am also trained in EMDR.In addition to being an LCSW with experience working with children and adolescents, I obtained advanced training and certification in Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT) for work with couples and families.

      "Are you suffering from anxiety, depression or the aftermath of trauma? Do you struggle with painful patterns in your life that persist despite your best efforts toward change? Are you nervous to try therapy because of the expense and exposure? Have strong effort and promising insights in previous therapy failed to bring you relief? Are you struggling with a difficult child or teenager and feeling like your good intentions and best efforts are not reaching them? Traditional, insight-oriented therapy may help with such challenges--but if not, behavioral therapy may help, regardless of success with mental insight and understanding.Insight may help you quickly, so I will always pursue insight with you. But I specialize where insight stops. I believe that what we do predominantly creates and/or maintains our thoughts and feelings. I use evidence-based techniques (exposure therapy, ACT and CBT) to help you reliably improve your behavior to positively change your thoughts and feelings.My approach works with or without medication, and is designed to minimize your risk by teaching you symptom-reducing skills quickly. I can work with your child/teenager directly, but I may be able to help you with them just by talking with you. I am somewhat technical, but you will find me kind, approachable and non-judgmental.

      "As a therapist, the connection between my client and me is central to the process.  By fostering a safe and deep relationship, we can explore both immediate and historical issues that are causing suffering and pain.  We will use a combination of mind, body and emotional understanding to explore the layers of the self.  With increased insight and awareness, you will feel a greater sense of well being and satisfaction in all areas of your life.My therapeutic approach uses both breath work and yoga therapy to help decrease reactivity, increase emotional understanding and develop a bigger \"tool box\" of coping skills for managing stress, anxiety and depression.  Whatever your issue, worry or concern, our connection will help you to understand yourself and make the necessary changes in your life.My combination of mind and body awareness works well for many issues, particularly anxiety, depression and eating disorders. I work with individual adults, couples and teenagers to develop a stronger, more stable sense of self, whether you are in an immediate crisis or want to improve your overall well-being and satisfaction."

      "Do you seek to better understand yourself, ease suffering, grow to your full potential, both individually and in relationships, and be more present in your life? Then you're in the right place. Many of the things with which we struggle, such as anxiety and depression, are ultimately tied to difficulties in how we relate to ourselves, and perhaps even more so, to others. Because of this, I see our relationship in therapy as the most important factor in helping you achieve your goals. When we feel supported, understood, and compassionately challenged, growth occurs over time at the level of the brain, promoting long-term change.Much of our work together involves helping you increase your awareness, ability to manage, and utilize your feelings in and out of session to live a valued life . This includes helping you connect with what you are experiencing in the present moment more fully and at a deeper level, as well as understanding how your past has come to influence your present.I work with adults 18 years and older, from all backgrounds. I see our work as wholly collaborative, with you as the expert in your own life and experience and myself as a guide to help you move towards the changes you desire. As such, I am flexible in my approach and regularly seek feedback from you about our work. I look forward to hearing from you!"

      "I specialize in helping people improve their relationships to others like a partner or a child, but most especially to one's self. Symptoms such as depression or anxiety, or feelings of shame, can interfere with these connections. Our psyches naturally want to move towards health and growth yet we can get stuck or hopeless that relief is possible. I believe in the value of self-acceptance. Given that many trauma feelings were created in relationship, I believe we need a trusting relationship to heal.

Through a nonjudgmental, authentic and compassionate stance, I strive to create a safe and collaborative space for you to explore sensitive issues, experiment with new behaviors, and work towards what matters to you.  Whether you'd like to improve the quality of your relationships, health, work or education, or address mental health challenges, such as anxiety, depression, loss, life transition, trauma and addiction, I will wholeheartedly support your efforts in fulfilling these goals.My primary approach, for both individuals and couples of diverse backgrounds, is Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, of which I’m also a trainer for mental health professionals.  ACT is an evidence-based practice that promotes the engagement of one's values along with skills to effectively handle the difficult thoughts and feelings that show up along the way.To best meet your needs or goals and ensure a good fit, I invite you to reach out to introduce yourself and ask questions about my approach and what you can expect from working with me.  I also have specialized training in trauma-based approaches and nutritional psychology.  I genuinely welcome people of all cultural and intersectional diversities."

      "Hi! Glad you’re here. I am a Clinical Psychologist licensed in CA where I have grown up and lived my entire life. I provide high quality virtual mental health care / individual therapy and counseling services to adults ages 18 and over throughout California. I specialize in in helping my clients with depression, anxiety, relationship problems and trauma/PTSD. My job is to help you get unstuck and focus on living your best life now. This may require managing difficult feelings, life challenges, and traumatic past experiences like childhood abuse. I love working with all clients of all backgrounds and identities.In addition to my telehealth private practice, I work in an adult outpatient psychiatry department. I specialize in working with clients with anxiety and depression as well as the LGBTQ/queer community and those with other marginalized identities. I employ a supportive, engaging, and collaborative style to empower my clients to reach their full potential.I recognize it can be hard to ask for help. Stigma about mental health can make that harder. I believe every client can succeed, and I think of myself as a fellow traveler on your adventure of self-actualization and growth. I provide an environment of warmth, safety, trust, and always a little humor. Please reach out if you think I might be able to help!"

      "When presented with problems we generally try to solve them as best we can with the tools available to us. Usually we're able to do so. However, sometimes this universal human instinct to problem-solve also creates the conditions of our own misery. In trying to \"think positive” or \"be happy\" or \"stop worrying,\" what we're really looking for is control. Yet the more we cling onto this control, the less effective it becomes over time. Not only do we feel worse than before, our lives become smaller and smaller until we feel trapped in a prison of our own creation.Although traditionally trained in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), I primarily use Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) in my work with clients. ACT employs mindfulness to better understand and learn to accept our desire to control. Only through this awareness are we given the freedom to choose how to live our lives: with intention.I hope I get the opportunity to hear your unique story and support your journey of creating meaning in this chaotic universe we share. If you feel my perspective may be beneficial for what you're currently going through, please reach out to schedule a free initial consultation. I'd also be happy to discuss any additional questions you may have at that time."

      "I help people turn toward more emotionally satisfying lives by providing a safe, non-judgmental, and compassionate atmosphere that facilitates growth. Do you feel as though you are merely surviving rather than fully living? We often live and act out scripts that are no longer satisfying or, even worse, inhibiting and destructive. I can guide you through a process of self discovery that deepens your capacity to face current challenges and enrich relationships. Whether you are struggling with anxiety, depression, life transitions, identity shifts, addiction, or family crisis, I believe the therapeutic process provides a rich landscape in which to heal.I am convinced that awakening the imagination in the context of therapy helps people create a more authentic and multifaceted self image. The re-imagining of the self opens people to the possibilities inherent in the present moment rather than their clinging to defensive coping patterns that no longer serve them.Our fast paced lifestyles and cultural values of high achievement are often not conducive to self understanding. I draw on my background as a former high school teacher and guidance counselor, to provide a springboard for clients to identify and access their hidden talents, untapped potential, and true  desires."

      "Are you feeling depleted and overwhelmed? Are you finding it difficult to connect with others or no longer feeling like yourself? I assure you, you are not alone. I am here to help. I have over 15 years of experience providing support to children, adolescents, adults and families struggling with anxiety, depression, interpersonal conflict and self-esteem issues. I really enjoy working with parents. One of my passions is working with people on the autism spectrum who want to build socialization skills that allow them to celebrate the beautiful person they are rather than focus solely on how they conform to societal norms.My therapeutic style is integrative and pulls from different therapy models depending on individual needs. Some of the therapy models I incorporate include: Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), the Gottman Method, compassion focused and client-centered therapy.I approach my work with clients from a place of genuine compassion and patience. I bring a transparent realness to the therapeutic process which I find fosters a healthy, trusting and secure relationship that lends itself to sustainable and positive change. I welcome you to contact me for a free phone consultation to explore whether I might be good fit you."

It takes time to build the therapeutic relationship, and I am respectful of where the client is rather than impose an agenda of my own.It takes great courage to seek help and allow oneself to be vulnerable to another.

As your therapist, I want to help you break down your problems and illuminate the parts of yourself that want to be discovered. I help clients that come from diverse cultural backgrounds, life stories, religions, and family traditions. I meet my clients with an endless curiosity and a passion to learn where they derive from. I adapt my therapy style by considering individuals’ generational histories.I work with multicultural individuals and couples who are motivated to work on their relationships and are looking for ways to strengthen their unity despite pressures from their differences. I believe finding your voice as a couple can help overcome societal expectations and connect you even closer.No matter what you have been through, there is an opportunity to create clarity and direction to navigate life’s uncertainties. I will provide a gentle, structured, caring space to free yourself from feeling powerless and to build your confidence. I am here if you are ready to take the next step in your healing."

I am a deeply empathetic and authentic person. I have a sense of humor. I am inquisitive about my client's journeys. In the rich ground of the therapeutic relationship historical wounding can be reworked and a new sense of self can flourish.I amalgamate techniques of guided imagery, mind/body awareness, active meditation and EMDR.

I believe in building a safe, respectful and compassionate relationship with my clients where we can exchange direct, honest, and meaningful feedback. Within this trusting relationship, we can explore your challenges and strengths so that you have more healthy choices regarding your life goals. Whether you struggle with anxiety, depression, stress, anger, isolation, grief or relationship issues, or if you simply want to live more authentically and fully, there is hope. Key elements in the change process include curiosity and a desire to learn about yourself.Because we are all unique, my therapy approach is flexible depending on your needs and goals. I integrate current research and a range of theoretical orientations in my practice (e.g., relational, attachment, neurobiology, mindfulness, and CBT). I work primarily with adults and older adolescents in individual and group psychotherapy.While individual therapy comprises much of my practice, as a Certified Group Psychotherapist, I know the power of group therapy to improve old relational patterns, sometimes in ways that surpass individual counseling. When relevant, this can be a wonderful treatment option. I welcome you to call for a free phone consultation."

Do you want to be seen and understood by others in a way that makes you proud to be you? Would you like to learn creative and compassionate ways of communicating with yourself and others, including some of the more challenging people in your life? Are old messages and hurts getting in the way? Do you want the freedom that comes from telling your story, leaving behind what doesn't serve you, and deciding on the next chapter?I work from my intuition, and encourage clients to listen more closely to theirs. I employ narrative exercises, music, poetry, art, breath work, guided visualization, and teachings from my yoga practice. Genuine connection brings alive these tools for anxiety and depression symptom management and trauma resolution. I also offer walking therapy sessions. Please reach out and let me know a bit about what you're facing, and get a sense of whether I might be able to support your path to a healthier mind, heart, and body- I practice from the belief these are deeply interconnected.  I strive for attuned, objective, and honest interactions, and would be honored to bear witness to your struggle and your healing.",

La coneccion genuina les da vida a estas tecnicas para manejar la ansiedad y la depresion y para resolver traumas. Ofrezco la terapia en caminata.

Whether you are interested in therapy in order to deal with challenges you have already identified in your life, or you are seeking therapy to connect to yourself, my aim is help you carve out a path and live a more meaningful life. Together we can work closely to deepen your understanding about your struggles and their underlying causes. I can provide you with a safe space to analyze your thought patterns and behaviors while supporting you through the process of making important changes in your life. I enjoy working with children, adolescents and adults. I might be a good fit for you if you would like to  (a) overcome feelings of depression and anxiety, and rediscover satisfaction and meaning in your life.  (b) seek help to effectively navigate life transitions such as beginning of school, a new career or a new relationship...(c) improve your ability to connect with people and work on unhealthy relationship patterns.  (d) process the impact of traumatic events on your life and build adaptive skills to cope with the effect of trauma. (e) deal with identity conflicts or explore issues pertaining to racial, cultural, ethnic identities. "

There is room for humor, despair, and mistakes. As our counseling relationship deepens, our interconnection becomes a means of healing and growth.

      "I believe strongly in meeting clients where they are at and taking a collaborative approach to meeting the treatment goals of therapy. I know for some, it can be anxiety provoking to seek therapy, and I strive to create an environment that is warm and focused on the issues that matter to the client.I graduated from UC Berkeley with a BA in Sociology, and then went to Oxford University and got my Masters in Evidence Based Social Intervention. I then got my Masters in Clinical Psychology from SF State, and became a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist in June of 2017.My orientation is psychodynamic, but I also believe that one size does not fit all, that it is important to tailor therapy to the needs of the client. I believe in the power of empathy, and I also provide direct feedback to clients. I have significant experience dealing with trauma."

      "Instead of looking at therapy as uncomfortable & difficult, consider this… we are our strongest when we have the courage to reveal & repair the most vulnerable aspects of ourselves. This is referred to as reframing, looking at a challenging situation in a new light. Let’s build some positive thinking patterns together. Laughing is also very therapeutic for the brain as it releases endorphins which increases focus, helps us integrate thoughts, & stimulates flexible thinking which are all important components of change & healing.I’m a strength-based therapist and would love the opportunity to hear your story and draw on my experience and expertise in helping you find the best answers for you.Work Experience: CHW Medical Foundation, Bayshore Family Center, Your House South, Sierra Vista Psychiatric Hospital (inpt/outpt)- Dialectical Behavioral Therapy/Art Therapy, Sutter Cancer Center- Bereavement Art Therapy, IEP driven mental health counseling/crisis response- Kings View Counseling, Yolo County Office of Ed, Davis Joint Unified School District."

      "YOU DON'T NEED MORE TALK - YOU NEED RELIEF. We don't do journaling out loud. Some forms of therapy can be the equivalent to what we call \"journaling out loud\" where each session is comprised of whatever you feel like sharing about from your week or your past. While this type of process is important to the counseling process and does occur in some amount each week, this isn't the work of therapy that facilitates healing. In our view, you will feel temporary relief from doing this in the same way that you do when journaling or talking to a friend. In counseling jargon we call this \"catharsis.\"RESILIENT RELIEF: Our belief is that sometimes therapists unnecessarily \"hold all the secrets\" by failing to teach you what they're doing. This leads to lack of confidence in your ability to use those skills outside of session. In truth, the goal of counseling is to finish in months (not years), and (ideally and in most cases) not need to come back. TACKLE TREATMENT-RESISTANT SYMPTOMS: Many times, we have been successful helping people who have been to counseling multiple times before and not felt the relief they were looking for. Part of how we can be effective in these scenarios is by not just focusing on present symptoms, but focusing on the root causes of the symptoms and addressing those."

      "Most people think you're doing well in life. They can't see how your past has left you feeling not good enough, full of self-doubt. You take responsibility for everything. You do a lot (and are great at some things), but your self-confidence can crumble instantaneously. You are stressed and anxious one minute, ashamed and depressed the next. You're no stranger to panic attacks, irritability, feeling blah, concentration troubles, or feeling numb. Your body is paying the price as well, with chronic tension, insomnia, high blood pressure, or unexplained physical symptoms. Living this way is exhausting!You want a life that's more flexible and true to you, free from shadows of the past. Talk therapy hasn't quite been the answer, and you're open to new approaches that acknowledge that trauma is stored in the body and is best resolved through body-informed psychotherapy.The next phase of your journey starts now!  If you are ready to give body-informed psychotherapy (Sensorimotor Psychotherapy) a try, you've come to the right place. Please call or visit my website to learn more about how I can help you. LGBT+ and BIPOC Affirming Practice. I am now providing online psychotherapy via Zoom for clients within California."

      "Regardless of where you are in your journey, participating in therapy can be beneficial in moving toward alleviating distress, or maximizing what is important to you.  I am a licensed clinical social worker with over 26 years of experience working in integrated health care settings, and have seen the myriad ways mental and physical health can affect people at various life stages. My approach is collaborative and integrative, with focus on the therapeutic relationship, because therapy is most effective when you are comfortable and feel valued.My goal is to understand and help you understand what is most important in the context of intersecting identities, while helping identify ways to navigate around the barriers that have prevented you from achieving those goals. Therapy can be a positive experience in which your strengths are recognized in the process.Although I believe the individual experience and life goals are the primary focus of therapy, I work with those living with depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, grief, gender identity, relational concerns, and adjustment. I have expertise in adult/pediatric oncology, HIV, and individuals living with chronic medical conditions and disabilities."

While a native Californian, I’ve been lucky enough to have lived in three different countries and have learned that no matter the land or language, people crave love and union. People are waiting to tell their story, be heard and accepted. I offer individualized, solution-oriented and science-backed care. My psychodynamic and empathic approach can help you gain clarity and find direction. I listen to my clients and meet them in their map of the world. Here, they learn insight and skills to empower themselves towards reaching their goals.Whatever stage you find yourself at today, I hope to a guide toward making meaningful choices that simplify and enrich your life.  If you have chosen to step bravely towards a new path, it would be my honor to serve as your guide and facilitator. But, you have to take the first step!

      "People want to be understood.  Everyone wants to feel good yet each day our moods change as life’s circumstances intrude.  Many times, the trauma we have experienced or our negative self-talk work to prevent us from good decisions. You may be considering counseling because you want to change something about yourself. For most people this kind of change can be hard work. To change yourself, it is helpful to understand how your thoughts, emotions and actions all interact to make up who you are. Real, lasting change is the result of a bunch of small changes that require a shift in thoughts and beliefs.This is where I come in. I listen to your story and help you gain clarity. I use talk, cognitive techniques, support, a positive attitude, emotional reframing, physical awareness, mindfulness, homework, articles that pertain to your issues, and referrals. Together we can help you attain your goals.Understanding emotions and freeing oneself from old negative messages is a journey which takes some work. When we make changes, we take a leap of understanding first and then our emotional being has to catch up so that the head and heart are in sync.   I work with you to uncover negative messages and release them for healing to occur."

      "Psychotherapy is one of the best ways to live an examined life, opening doors to a deeper understanding of yourself and to a new way of being in the world.  Mindfully tending to your psychological space, each of our sessions will focus on exploring practical answers to everyday problems, resolving fears and uncertainties, improving your life, and discovering how the psyche responds inwardly to overwhelming life events or when life-shattering events destroy outer meaning altogether.  Even unavoidable and unpleasant experiences can be a source of psychological freedom.With focused attention, we will reflect on whether something is worth doing, and whether the results of an action are likely to be good for you or for the world. Rather than be an unconscious victim, our sessions will help you participate in a process of finding meaning in your suffering, worth in your reality, and greater flexibility in your thinking.Re-formulating awareness of your situation, opening new connections and freeing your imagination, you will discover how to respond most effectively to changes that are always happening. Our therapy can help you navigate the voyage of your life, connect you to the creative unconscious, and provide an optimal mental experience and, even, transformation."

      "Self-doubt, shame, and rejection by the ones we love are some of the most psychologically painful experiences a person can endure. Any one or combination of these three can leave us spinning in confusion and frustration about what to do or try to make things better. Inner peace and relationship happiness frequently lie just out of reach but it’s hard to know where to get help that’s applicable directly to you and your situation. Often it feels like we have exhausted all our options, but sometimes all that is needed is a trained eye with an unbiased perspective on the situation. This is exactly what therapy can provide for you.While I have a passion for working with couples, I see a wide range of individuals struggling with various challenges in life as well. I make sure to work with my clients in a collaborative way that ensures that therapy is best tailored to the client’s needs and preferences. I currently have Tues-Thurs and Sun availability. I'm honored to be a part of your journey as we tackle challenges together and pave a road to a better way of being. Please feel free to call or email me so we can talk about getting started.

      "Through connection, empathy and a non-judgmental approach, I offer ways to help you discover what may be blocking you from finding your true path in life. By not seeing an individual for what symptoms they have or what is affecting them, I am more interested in helping you find what is the cause of symptoms and how to process them. I provide a safe space for anyone who is looking to improve their lives, build better relationships with family, friends or partners and learn to let go of the things that are holding you back from your goals.  I work with adults, adolescents and couples from all backgrounds. I am also open to any culture, belief, identification or orientation. All are welcome. I base all individual therapy on a client-focused approach and adapt sessions to the needs of each person. For couples, I incorporate the foundations of The Gottman Method and The Sound Relationship House.Everyone has their own individual path in life and no two people are exactly the same. My career path as a therapist had several stops along the way, including college athletics and non-profit food banks. I would be honored to have the opportunity to not only learn your story but join with you in moving towards your goals and path in life. "

      "For most of my clients depression or anxiety is impacting life in a negative way. Sometimes grief causes this disruption; sometimes a history of early life trauma continues to undermine a sense of well-being; sometimes low self-esteem or feelings of being alone are intensifying. One may be struggling and hasn't yet found a way to make sense of why--\"something just feels wrong inside of me but others cannot see or understand it.\"Drawing on training in relational psychology, trauma therapies, griefwork, and mindfulness meditation, I focus on building a genuine relationship, supporting an inquiry that allows you to settle into who you really are. Our work honors what is sensed and felt in the body, and clears pathways for insight.As each person needs something slightly different, we figure out together which practices and what timing fit given the whole of your life. The goal is to understand, reassure, and relax the protective layers so that what is authentic may come into being."

      "I find it useful to combine your goals for change as well as the aim to get to know yourself better as the foundation for therapy. My training in trauma and LGBTQ+ informed care is foundational to my work with you. I have training and experience working with many different presenting issues and identities, as well as clients' support systems (partners, parents, families, children.) I work relationally with individuals, families, and couples. We all come to relationships with particular attachment styles, family histories, trauma experiences, identities, and expectations. Add life’s stressors to the mix, and at times we find ourselves needing some extra support. I believe that the intersection of cultural identities inform each of our experiences, which is always at work, always relevant.I routinely provide consultation and trainings to mental health professionals and school professionals in clinical and educational settings on providing LGBTQ- and transgender/nonbinary- affirmative care, as well as provide psychological testing and assessment services (ADHD testing, academic/achievement testing, diagnostic clarification.)"

      "I prioritize developing a therapeutic relationship that is founded upon trust, integrity, compassion, and non-judgment. The emphasis is less focused on \"pathology\" and more on strength, resilience, and developing an optimal worldview. It is my hope to support you to be more content in life, learn new ways to re-engage life and become more empowered to enact your vision of change. It takes tremendous courage to take the first steps toward healing, change, and growth. Thank you for considering working with me to support you on this journey.I have training and experience addressing various mental health concerns that range from depression, anxiety, relational conflict to gender dysphoria. I also have specialized experience working with same-gender-loving, lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual, queer individuals, as well as, gender fluid, transgender, non-binary, and other gender-diverse folks.In addition to my background in providing individual and group therapy, I have completed a 200 hour Yoga Teacher Training Program at Niroga Institute. If appropriate and mutually agreed upon, yoga and/or mindfulness meditation can be integrated into psychotherapy treatment."

      "During the past 30 years of working as a psychotherapist, I have helped people with anxiety, depression, loss, relationship and work issues, and often just a general sense that something isn't right.  As a Jungian and relational therapist, I am empathic, nonjudgemental, nonpatholgizing, and deeply interested in the uniqueness of each human being who comes to me.  Warm and down-to-earth, I enjoy exploring deeper levels of experience but can be practical and provide suggestions and tools when that is what is needed.With post-graduate training in the psychology of women, I love helping women develop trust in themselves, learn to value themselves for who they are, find the courage to do what is best for themselves, and to discover inner strengh and wisdom that they didn't know they had.I also love helping people who were abused or neglected as children to understand the effects of that abuse or neglect, such as overwhelming internal negative messages about themselves, as effects of the abuse, not as truth, and to become an \"aman cara\" (Gaelic for soul friend) to themselves."

      "Welcome! If you are feeling overstimulated and overwhelmed by life right now, I see you. If you are feeling confused about who you are amid life transitions or traumatic experiences, you are not alone. When a traumatic event happens, however big or small, we learn to hide parts of ourselves we deem unacceptable or unlovable. When we are faced with a big life change or constant stressors, these parts will pop up and make us feel out of control. It’s hard to trust yourself when there is a war going on in your head, and your body is screaming “danger!” at every turn.I am here to help you explore those parts of you that are longing for attention and care. I believe that your body holds the innate wisdom to bring you back to your truest self. Through IFS and Somatic practices, we will work on helping you feel safe in your body so you can begin to trust yourself and move through your life with confidence.We will be a good fit if you are looking for someone who is warm, friendly, and curious. I would be honored to be a guide on your healing journey, and I look forward to getting to know you!"

      "I focus on the development of the therapeutic relationship, first and foremost. This can look like: learning about you, prioritizing what you bring to session, and gently encouraging you to work toward your identified goals. I use what comes up in the therapy space as opportunities for relational skill-building, such as focusing on strengths, building self-compassion, learning to identify wants/needs, regulating emotions, and working through conflict. I interweave understandings of sociocultural context to contextualize your experience, and to move the foci of change from what isn't in your control to what is.I specialize working with queer and trans BIPOC folks. Having worked in university counseling for seven+ years, I also have extensive experience working with: life transitions, career, procrastination, emotion regulation, codependency, perfectionism, identity development, privilege and power, and relationships (friends, partner(s), family, coworkers, etc.)If you're struggling with being hard on yourself and others, like you're hitting a wall with trying to change something about yourself or your relationships, I have a wild hunch that, perhaps, there are reasons. And through this growth process, I hope we can learn to understand, accept, and shift what's in your control and allow for what isn't."

      "Do you ever find yourself overthinking situations or experiencing thoughts going so fast it's hard to keep up with them? What about experiencing extreme sadness with a lack of motivation to do anything, even get out of bed? Has there been a time when you felt like crying but you couldn't figure out why? I understand these thoughts and feelings, and together we can work on decreasing feelings of stress, sadness, hopelessness, and isolation, regardless of the situation.We can also work on finding out WHY these feelings continue to happen. Feeling overwhelmed is exhausting, and with my knowledge and skills in treating anxiety, depression, OCD, and substance use/abuse, we can work on this together, so these feelings don't happen as often. I assure you; you will always be heard with empathy and compassion and no judgement.No situation is too big or too small; the focus is learning how to tackle your concerns with confidence. My specialties include anxiety, depression, OCD, substance use/abuse, domestic abuse/violence, and legal concerns, including probation and parole. Together, we can work through anything."

      "There are many paths to healing and change. The journey is an active one and there is success in simply taking the first step, acknowledging a change is needed.  I have worked in mental health services since 1988 and have worked with many different people and issues.  I believe that developing awareness, of emotions, thoughts and behavior, is the starting place and that understanding where we come from, what got us here can be helpful, but changing how we feel today is the best way to have a sense of power.  I specialize in somatic, or a body based approach to treatment of trauma. Please call or email me for a therapy session today.I specialize in working with people with chronic and traumatic stress, anxiety and depression that result from the undischarged life stressors. Focusing on strategies from Somatic Experiencing, developed by Dr. Peter Levine,PhD, I provide active skills to heal the impact of single event and developmental or relational trauma.Have you experienced single event or multiple traumas? Do you experience anxiety, depression or chronic pain from syndromes? Have you experienced developmental trauma, a chaotic childhood or other chronic traumatic stress? I specialize in Somatic Experiencing, an exciting and powerful treatment approach to working with these complex issues. "

      "I am dually licensed as an MFT and a Psychologist.  I am also a hypnotherapist.   I treat many conditions.  Depression, Anxiety and PTSD for example. I believe that the therapeutic connection is essential;  I respect my youngers as well as my elders.  However, I believe that what differentiates a psychotherapist from a paid friend is a mastery of the unconcious.  I therefore include in my practice methods that tap into a person's inner knowledge of self: EMDR, Natural Processing, hypnosis, inner child work and Gestalt dreamwork.  I see the unconcious as the last frontier, and we are pioneers!If a person is not motivated to overturn their psychic rocks, I can use hypnosis to increase relaxation and improve functioning in a more direct manner.\nPersons seeking to purge a past trauma are well served by EMDR.  \nPersons not sure can often find their way with Gestalt dreamwork.I was given the Patients' Choice award for my Woodland practice in 2016, by Opencare.    My clients love my sense of humor. Many of my clients get more out of therapy than they expected to.   Featured in Laurie Cole Johnson's  book Finally Winning.  Fluent in Spanish.  De veras!"

      "You are committed to feeling better, you've tried everything, but still you feel lost in the pain. You've always been able to \"fix\" things in your life, why not this?  This time, you feel stuck. Maybe you feel gripped by anxiety or panic. Maybe you feel consumed by grief from trauma or loss of a person, pet, or life dream. Maybe you're finding yourself in new life circumstances (a significant health challenge, life milestone, career or relationship change) and wonder \"who am I now\"? Life has a way of challenging us. There is a way through.I specialize in helping people move through the challenges of anxiety, grief/loss, and life transitions. Your own voice holds the wisdom to your healing. I offer a mind-body oriented approach, including EMDR, Brainspotting, and mindful-somatic awareness to help you rediscover that voice and learn to listen and trust it again.My approach provides a compassionate, nonjudgmental space, the conditions I believe we all need to heal and flourish. You are making a skillful decision for yourself by seeking help. Schedule a free phone consultation, through my website or phone, and let's explore how to help you find your way."

      "If you are feeling sad, anxious, or simply unhappy, you are definitely not alone. My philosophy is that people do the best they can with what they have, but sometimes anxiety, stress, grief, depression and relationship issues can contribute to our feeling stuck. My genuine belief is that change is always possible and begins with being motivated to do something different. My approach is both collaborative and supportive and will help you explore the changes you'd like to make in order to live a more meaningful and purposeful life.My treatment approach incorporates mindfulness to help people cope with the debilitating symptoms of anxiety and depression.  I also utilize EMDR as an adjunct for individuals who have experienced trauma. In addition, I have a particular interest in working with couples and have specialized training in EFT (Emotionally Focused Therapy)."

      "I work with people who are struggling, and decide take the courageous step to ask for help. Many have a history of trauma and suffer from anxiety, depression, eating disorders, addiction, parenting challenges, sleep issues, sexual difficulties, chronic pain, relationship problems, and other post-traumatic responses. Also, present-day situations in our personal or collective worlds can be objectively hard to bear. Our experiences leave traces psychologically and somatically, so I use evidence-based, body-oriented, mindfulness techniques to address limiting patterns so that you can live more authentically today's challenging world.My clients describe me as calm, kind, and real. I appreciate the role of humor, and I am not afraid to gently and directly challenge you when it is useful. We will collaborate, working together on your goals as a team, to help you make the changes you want in your life. Meanwhile, we will celebrate and honor your willingness to engage in this valuable work.I graduated from University of Michigan, attended California Institute of Integral Studies and JFK University, and received my graduate degree in Somatic Psychotherapy from JFK. I have training in Sensorimotor Psychotherapy, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, EMDR, Clinical Hypnosis, and earned a Certificate in Complex Trauma and Dissociation from ISSTD."

Working together using a whole self approach addresses what I identify as balance - body, mind, and soul (content or peace) that helps develop a strong relationship with yourself.  Seeking therapy can be a scary adventure, but well worth it.I am transparent, open, and honest with each person I come in contact with, I am here to help you on your journey with mindfulness, understanding, and evidence-based techniques."

Together, we'd  decide about the goodness of our fit. In my practice I work mainly with adults in individual or couple therapy as well as with psychotherapists who want consultation, particularly consultation that incorporates their personal psychological work. I bring 25+ years of experience to the practice of psychotherapy and continue to feel grown and deepened by this process.Deeply interested in people,  I respect the courage it takes to seek this work whether on a long or short-term basis and have a patient trust in this process as a means of learning and healing.  My initial training was grounded in psychodynamic theory which still shapes my thinking.However, how I work is informed by various approaches and crafted to the person.  Personally, I'm warm, patient and calm; able to create space safe and quiet enough for letting  what needs to marinate do just that; active enough to maintain momentum, and offer a bit  of humor on occasion."

The  problems I treat range from mild to severe psychological and psychiatric difficulties ranging from depression, loss, anxiety and trauma to relationship difficulties.

      "Relationship difficulties can preoccupy one's life. My clients find themselves stuck in repetitive negative communication patterns, they have experienced a recent injury to their emotional bond or fear that the trust in their partner has been broken. Sometimes they repeatedly reach out for emotional connection with their partner, only to end up in the same old disconnecting cycle that leaves them feeling alone and demoralized. Often, they appear like they have it all together yet feel isolated and unsure how to find the right kind of help.My clients want the ability to stop these endless loops of negative communication, repair the emotional injuries and find a deep sense of understanding and love with their partner. They want to build a relationship that feels safe and accessible where each person can not only be heard, but have a felt sense of connection and security.Human beings are wired for love and connection. I use this lens along with the empirically validated Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT) to help you move from a place of distress to a place of feeling heard, connected and loved. I have been working with couples since 2013. I know what helps and would be happy to assist in that process."

      "I specialize in the treatment of all anxiety-related disorders, including OCD, Social Anxiety, and Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake.  After developing a treatment protocol at the Intensive Program level that was the first in the nation to integrate mindfulness-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (\"ACT\") with Exposure Therapy in the treatment of OCD, I am continuing that work in private practice.  My focus is on helping people respond differently to the physical sensations of anxiety, get some space from \"sticky\" thoughts, and to return to the present moment.Before beginning any kind of exposure to anxiety-producing situations, we will lay a foundation for experiencing the anxiety differently.  People report that it's much easier to approach anxious situations this foundation in place.  We will then refine these skills as you encounter different situations.People often find talk therapy to be ineffective for OCD.  CBT is a common alternative but can be problematic because the goal of changing dysfunctional thoughts to functional ones if often experienced as similar to the battle with thoughts that already goes on in people's minds."

      "I have 20 years of experience specializing in identifying the cause of learning struggles.  I provide screenings and full evaluations for Dyslexia, Dyscalculia, Dysgraphia, and all other educational disabilities, including Autism and Intellectual disabilities.   Follow up counseling can also be provided to help clients maximize their learning potential and understand their own strengths and weaknesses.  With this understanding comes hope and the relief of knowing how to advocate for appropriate accommodations and services in school and college.  I also provide Gifted IQ testing.I use the most current evaluation tools and technology that makes testing fun and saves time.  This means I can charge less for my evaluations.  Holding dual licenses that allow me to work in both schools and private practice means that educational agencies must consider my testing results as a qualified examiner.I’m also a qualified Independent Educational Evaluation (IEE) provider.  Knowing how to navigate school resources can be intimidating.  I understand educational systems and can help you advocate for your child's needs.  My approach is always non-adversarial and solution focused.  Results can be used in IEP, 504, SAT/ACT, and College accommodation planning. "

      "Is anxiety getting in your way of you leading your best life? Is something that happened in your life years or even decades ago still impacting you and you don't know how to move past it? Are experiences from your past impacting your relationships? Your work? Your ability to be your best self? Do you have physical symptoms that don't seem to have a medical cause but cause you difficulty in your life? Are you experiencing unexplained panic symptoms? Therapy can help. My work focuses on healing past traumas to help you get your life back. I utilize a two pronged approach. 1) I will help you build skills to cope with current symptoms through mindfulness, guided imagery,  and cognitive behavioral skills.  2) I utilize evidence based practices including EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing), and Attachment Focused therapy to help address the core reasons for the symptoms. Reaching out for help is the first step towards feeling better! Please feel free to call or email me to schedule a free phone consultation. We can discuss your goals for therapy, and talk about my practice style to see if it might be a good fit for your current needs. "

      "I will work with you to guide you through your depression, grief, anxiety, relationship or spiritual issues to find harmony, comfort, health and balance. I work with an integrative approach. The outcome of therapy is usually greater self-knowledge, a re-integration of de-pressed thoughts, emotions, and beliefs, and a new relationship with self, others, and the world.  Therapy often involves structured \"talk\" therapy, creative work, an exploration of your dreams, religious experiences, and personal myths.In our hectic life styles we are often told to “just get over it” without taking time to nurture what needs to heal. I work with depression, anxiety, grief, relationship issues (pre-marriage, separation and divorce) and spiritual issues to guide you toward a more satisfying and authentic life.My approach to psychotherapy is guided by the work of C.G. Jung and others who believe that healing is never a temporary fix but an unfolding process meant to bring lasting health and happiness. Psychotherapy is an opportuniy to work toward experiencing yourself more fully."

      "I have worked as a psychotherapist for over 20 years. I meet you where you are, attending to the particular needs and goals you bring, helping you discover more meaning, wholeness, and pleasure in your life. The daily choices we make are often informed by our early life experiences. Despite our best efforts to change, we often find ourselves repeating unwanted patterns over and over.  As we sit together, exploring your feelings, your stories, and listening to your dreams and longings,  we will find ways you can open yourself up to the possibility of change, finding new energy and meaning.We can help you to explore yourself, your relationships, & your direction in life. When you become more aware of patterns and narratives that have shaped you, you will develop the tools & resources necessary to feel better, act, & live a more satisfying life. Whether you're experiencing distress, struggling with a transition, or simply wanting to grow.My practice is designed to help you develop the skills you need to become more resilient to the pressures & stressors of life & to live a meaningful authentic life, striving towards wholeness. When we become more aware, we open to life, & we can meet challenges with more presence &  groundedness. Together we will work towards nurturing who you uniquely are."

      "Being a part of the military can add a complicated layer to life and especially to family life. Not only does the military bring its own culture and obligations, it also brings its own \"family\" component that can get \"tangled\" when interwoven. Often times service members and partners find themselves struggling to balance family life with work and military life and when life is out of balance a multitude of issues can arise such as depression and anxiety, not to mention coping with any added stress such as combat experiences or other trauma within or out of the military.I specialize in therapy for service members (both current and prior) and their families. Often times service members and family struggle with similar issues as civilians such as: anxiety, depression, substance abuse, PTSD, marital discord, relational dissatisfaction, lack of motivation, etc. except military service can complicate matters further.Being part of a military family has allowed me the privilege of gaining inside understanding and perspective of just how challenging military service can be and the impact it can have on the service member and the family."

      "I believe our mutual job is to work together to help you find the best ways of dealing effectively with your problem. Sometimes, although we may know the answers to our problems, we have never been taught the skills to implement that knowledge. Part of my job is to use my expertise and education to teach those skills. For example, we may realize we are being misunderstood by others and work hard to be understood, but no matter how hard we try, nothing changes. Teaching communication skills is one of my areas of expertise that may prove useful.My theoretical approach is eclectic, meaning I do not hold to one specific theory  but use a variety of approaches in my therapy. These include psychodynamic therapy,  Rogerian (Person Centered) therapy, Cognitive/Behavioral therapy, and Hypnotherapy as well as a variety  of other techniques, depending on the  situation we are working with.I am a retired law enforcement officer and a Vietnam Veteran."

I  published over 100 scientific articles on the process and outcome of therapy and the influence of sex and race biases in diagnosis and treatment.In 1975, I moved to the Department of Psychiatry at the University of California at Davis, where I continued teaching and seeing patients and served as the Director of Doctoral Training in Clinical Psychology.

      "I have been in clinical practice for 25 years. I have been able to work with people from all walks of life who may be struggling with issues that may either be long-standing or contemporary in nature. Therapy begins with trying to help my clients arrive at clearer conceptualizations as to why they are struggling. The reasons behind the struggle may based in history and/or based on a present challenge. My view is that when one has a more accurate view of the issue, solutions, with  therapeutic guidance, tend to follow more naturally.I am first and foremost a clinical psychologist both in terms of training and experience. Over the years I have developed subspecialties in psychological assessment and couples therapy.  I  also work as a sports psychologist with athletes, professional and otherwise, who are looking to enhance their performance, focus and concentration."

      "Anxiety, depression, grief, loss, and ruptures in relationships are among the many issues that rob us of our happiness and well-being. I have over 15 years of experience working with children, adolescents and adults in therapy. I see therapy as a sacred space to work through the underlying issues that keep us stuck in our suffering. I deeply enjoy working along side individuals and families as they come to find healing from old wounds and a better sense of identity, peace, happiness and fulfillment. I especially enjoy working with college students, adults and couples. Anxiety and depression effect many people and can take specific support to overcome. Many factors cause anxiety and depression. Often developmental transitions (going to college), family history, or current painful losses or relationships can trigger these reactions. I am comfortable working with the many factors that create symptoms.Among the most dynamic and often stressful time periods of life are during developmental transitions. I am passionate about working with young adults/college students through those transitions. Often during transitions at any stage, relationships change or end, new symptoms arise, and discomfort increases. I enjoy working with people through these changes. "

I work with a traditional social work Strengths Based perspective, which means that I look for what you do well, and how you have successfully coped in the past. With a Cognitive Behavioral structure, we also look at which behaviors you might want to alter, as well as the thinking distortions that tend to be underneath our areas of dysfunction.With couples: communication, conflict management, expectations and ways to express love to each other.                                                                         \nWith Clinical Supervision, LCSW or LMHP: awareness of how your own patterns influence your work.With individuals, couples in therapy, or with an individual or family in a life transition, or with a professional working on his or her supervision hours, I will begin with you where you are, and with compassion and respect support you in helping you achieve your goals."

      "I treat those who have experienced trauma in their life, and have over 10 years of experience working with domestic violence, sexual abuse, and child abuse. I work with people of various cultures, sexual orientations, and gender identities and know that Trauma is non-discriminatory. Trauma often creates patterns and loops that extend into many areas of a person's life, and can be difficult or painful to overcome. Sometimes the way people survive their trauma brings them more pain, adds to the chaos, and reinforces negative beliefs that perpetuate the cycle.I work with clients to overcome their past, calm their bodies, and bring peace to their own lives. My practice focuses on bolstering strengths so they can face their past and find new meaning in life. I utilize a variety of techniques, such as grounding and meditation, somatic interventions, EMDR, as well as talk therapy techniques.I can hold space for you and teach you how to hold that space for yourself. Join me to learn ways to care for yourself and move past the trauma that has been haunting you. You are a survivor, and I can help you become a thriver."

      "Something’s wrong, but you can’t put your finger on it. Or maybe you know what’s wrong, but don’t know what to do about it. Your child is acting out at school, at home, or with others, they are reactive or do socially inappropriate things, maybe they’re even avoidant or acting depressed. The bottom line is you’re worried, but maybe you’re also concerned that you’re overthinking it or that it’s just “how they are” and there’s nothing you can do. The truth is that these problems can be a sign of trauma, anxiety, or depression in children and they can be improved or addressed all together with the right kind of help.You can have a more satisfying relationship with your child, feel less like a failure as a parent, and look forward to school conferences. You and your child can navigate the ups and downs across developmental stages and life stressors.Dr. Ayala is one of eight people in the Sacramento area IFECMHS certified (Infant, Infant-Family, and Early Childhood Mental Health). She specializes in complex trauma/PTSD, anxiety, depression, and attachment-based issues in children and families.

      "Life's demands leave you feeling overwhelmed, depressed, and burned out. You don’t know who you are because you have spent your life just trying to get by. Despite having strong values, you have internalized societal standards and become your biggest critic. Sometimes you feel so different from people around you, you wonder if you will ever fit in or feel understood. Past pain and traumas continue to influence daily life, keeping you stuck in old patterns, fears, and wounds. The climate crisis and life under neoliberal capitalism leave you feeling understandably anxious and depressed.With the support of therapy, you hope to create a life that aligns with your values and needs. You want to find ways to care for and support yourself. Maybe this includes unmasking, being more present in your body, learning to accommodate your needs, finding community, or connecting to creativity.If you would like to do this work with a queer and neurodiversity-affirming therapist, I might be a good fit. To talk more about your needs and how we might work together, reach out so that we can set up a consultation.

      "I work with adults and couples using a relational approach that emphasizes connection: being seen, heard, and valued for who you are and where you are in your journey. My goal is to create a welcoming, nurturing, non-judgmental space where you feel safe to share your needs and explore the factors and patterns that may be impacting your quality of life. As an immigrant, I am particularly sensitive to the many ways different people show vulnerability, and strive to take multicultural, interpersonal, and contextual factors into account in order to get to know the multiple identities forming our whole selves.I have a direct and transparent approach, and work collaboratively to identify goals and tailor treatment to your specific needs. I practice research supported therapies and often draw from humanistic, cognitive behavioral and mindfulness based techniques. I have received specialized training in EFT for couples, CBT, DBT & Motivational Interviewing.I believe everyone is capable and worthy of healthy relationships with themselves and others. I feel so grateful for the opportunity to help clients increase awareness of and comfort with emotions, improve relationships, and achieve a more balanced and fulfilling life. Please contact me for a consultation to find out if I may be a good fit for you. "

Do you feel overwhelmed, anxious, frustrated and alone in this world as you do your best to connect to others?  Maybe social anxiety is holding you back.  Maybe you aren’t quite where you want to be in your relationships or career.  Maybe adulting is … well… kinda crappy? I use humor, down to earth therapeutic conversations, and evidence-based skills.  Visit lovehealgrow.com to learn more or scheduling online today.  In person appointments available!I’m the type of therapist who knows sometimes life doesn’t lead where you expect it to.  And that can be scary, disappointing, ironic…or even wonderful.  Life has ups and downs.  When you’re reaching out for therapy you might feel like you’re on a downward spiral.  But I will make space to see you for your strengths, hopes, and dreams, too.I am all for challenging the traditional or what society tells us is the way things \"should\" be.  Your relationships, your career, your sexual desires-if you are trying to fit in the box that society says is \"normal\" you might find that you're feeling stressed, anxious, and depressed.  Let's work through this together in therapy!"

      "For many people, standard 12 step-dominated substance use treatment does not work.  People may tell you that your problem is a lack of willingness, or that you are in \"denial.\"  But maybe you need someone to listen to you rather than talk at you.  The fact that these programs do not work for you does not mean that you are not capable of change.  It probably just means that you have not found an approach that addresses your individual needs and values.Harm reduction is a philosophy which meets you where you are rather than imposing rigid demands.  My name is Jeremy Prillwitz, and I’m a Licensed Advanced Alcohol and Drug Counselor (LAADC).   I have worked as a harm reduction-based counselor for the past ten years.    My expertise is evidence-based treatment, but YOU are the expert on your life.Let's work together to learn the underlying causes of your struggles with substances, and to find solutions which address those causes.  Merely treating symptoms or following someone else's recipe for recovery is unlikely to bring lasting change.  If you are empowered to seek out your own truth, you will find the right answers.  I can help you do that."

Jennifer also offers clinical supervision to pre-licensed therapists (ASW, AMFT, APCC). In addition to therapy and supervision, she provides consulting to therapists seeking to start or grow their private practice. She's also passionate in counseling other mental health providers.She specializes in helping individuals reach their goals whether it be optimizing a relationship, a career change, managing grief, or just feeling overall better. Jennifer also works with couples and families, and she is happy to adjust her therapeutic approach to match the needs of her clients and meet them wherever they are at.

Whether you are grappling with anxiety, depression, addiction, trauma, relationship issues, or beyond, you are not alone. I am a Licensed Clinical Social Worker and would be honored to work with you. For many, therapy can provide a safe space to unpack and explore your feelings, experiences, thoughts, and fears while aligning with your values, goals and hopes to become more present, connected and fulfilled in your life.

I have a talent for understanding people and their individual needs and qualities. I see what drives them and what holds them back.  Behaviors that may seem negative to others, make sense to me as I’m able to see their function.Once you and your family feel understood, I can offer strategies and skills to reduce behaviors causing distress in the family, increase positive interactions, and ultimately help build a more cohesive and harmonious family unit. I will work with your family in your home, community, or the traditional office setting depending on the needs of your family.With over 20 years of experience working with children, adolescents, and families, I have successfully provided intervention for a diverse array of families and children with disruptive behaviors.

      "Frustrated? Unhappy? Want some insight and change? I offer an encouraging approach to help you explore your world in a therapeutic environment. I believe that everyone is the expert of their own experience; you have lived your life longer than I have known you. I often use the metaphor of being a flashlight in a dark cave, shedding light on different things, however, you, as the client are in the driver's seat; I am in the passenger seat, as a co-driver. Together, we will explore your personal meanings and experiences while making larger connections to your goals.  I invite you to our journey together in creating new meaning.I offer psychotherapy & a relational view regarding anxiety, grief/loss, body image/self esteem/ weight issues, intimacy problems, divorce, pre-marital, LGBT issues, and military related issues. I also have experience working with couple related issues as well. Please also check out my website for further information (\"services\" tab). I also have a specialization with cultural and racial issues, and have an interest in working with interracial and intercultural couples and families. I also have experience working with clients regarding parenting/co-parenting, sibling/coworker/relationships. In addition, addiction/substance, trauma, and domestic violence. "

      "Your past does not define who you are today and who you want to be. Life can be challenging and sometimes adverse experiences can affect how we view and navigate the world. These experiences often leave us feeling powerless, hopeless, disconnected, and alone. Our responses to stress and trauma are individual and personal. We feel like we’re treading water without the right guidance.  This is exhausting and interferes with our well-being. We just want to be seen and heard and know how to move past it all.I am a relational and trauma therapist. With years of experience working in diverse clinical settings with clients struggling with varied life challenges, there’s not much I haven’t seen.  I provide therapy using evidence-based tools. My clients walk away from therapy with me feeling validated, supported, and confident in using the skills they've learned.My lived experiences make me a better therapist. When we work together, you won't just get a trained therapist. You'll get someone who truly understands what you're going through."

      "As James Baldwin famously said, \"not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed unless faced\", I also offer you the following poem: \"When we feel safe, anything is possible. We become unstoppable. Because we have a firm ground to launch and a safe ground to land. We can then stand. Voice ourselves, show ourselves. Life becomes a dance.\"I look forward to learning about the journey that brought you to explore personal growth and self-discovery.

      "When our lives are destabilized it's hard to think and emotions are rocking.  At the very same time that more is asked of us, new stressors may amplify old self-doubt.  A therapist can ask questions that lead to new behaviors - helping you find your wise mind and accepting what you must - so you may reclaim strength. There are tools that can support your path towards resilience.  If symptoms have made their way into your daily functioning, don't stay in a place of misery.  Let me help you get back to your best self.I believe healing is an emotion/mind/body experience. I am a DBT therapist who loves to bring mindfulness into learning new behaviors. I will support the focus on your desired outcome for therapy, while bringing my experience to the table to assist. If you do the work I trust you'll find ways to suffer less and to make your life worth living.When I moved to California I experienced a significant JOLT!  Nearly everything changed and I lost most of my support system and some of my self.  Following wise guidance I invested in the people and activities that brought joy.  Most importantly, I learned to talk less and to DO more!  What is your story?  What do you fear? What strengths can you count on?"

      "Do you struggle on the inside, even if others see you as capable? Maybe you criticize yourself or think you should be achieving more. I work with people who are successful in some areas and not in others. They may be frequently frustrated, disappointed, ashamed, or even angry, but they don’t know why. So they beat themselves up, hide their pain, and often give up on their dreams. As a therapist, I help my adult and adolescent clients discover how to respect, trust, and care for themselves, so they can live life fully again.To tailor treatment, I will listen with care and respect for where you want to be and where you have been. I often work with individuals who deal with loss, chronic medical conditions, marginalized identity, situational or multi-generational trauma, and so balance a developmental lens, a sociocultural perspective and strengths-based approaches.Therapy is often a dance between challenge and encouragement. Once we've established trust in the relationship, I help my clients safely face whatever is happening or has happened to them; I specialize in noticing and drawing your attention to moments of success. I welcome a conversation to see if my approach is the right fit for you and your concerns."

      "Are you feeling overwhelmed or “stuck”? Are you wanting more from life? Are you struggling with letting go, changing, getting rid of and/or avoiding difficult and painful thoughts and feelings? Utilizing a genuinely warm, humorous, and direct humanistic approach, I will gently challenge you and invite you to step out of your current comfort zone and step into authentic, mindful living. Throughout our sessions, we will: hold space for difficult thoughts and feelings, highlight underlying patterns of thinking and behaving that may no longer serve you, and imagine new ways of being and doing.I utilize experiential and value-driven behavioral techniques to encourage clients to practice and integrate the skills cultivated during our sessions together into their daily lives. As an Indigenous (Northern Sierra Miwok) woman and scholar, I greatly appreciate the complex individual and collective contexts and narratives that each of us embody and enact.I believe it essential to explore and appreciate where we have come from in order to understand who we are and who we will become. Overall, I am committed to fostering an open and safe environment to support you and honor your experiences as you continue upon your lifelong journey of self-love and growth. I look forward to working with you soon."

      "Hi! I'm Rebeks (they/them) - a transmasculine nonbinary therapist who specializes in trauma, LGBTQIA+ affirmative therapy, and life with chronic illness, disability, college/academia, and affirmative approaches to neurodiversity such as Autism, ADHD, and OCD. I love working with folx in the \"gray spaces\" of identity who aren't quite sure they are (fill in the blank)  enough. My approach to therapy is to provide solidity and a sense of containment to enable the deeper healing-work — especially for those with complex trauma, dissociation and early attachment ruptures.I'm not here to help you adjust better to the unjust, but rather to reject the oppressive messages we all have internalized and reclaim your authentic self. I utilize a range of modalities, including attachment-based reparative approaches & EMDR, to help you create a fulfilling life that is more than the sum of what happened to you.I fundamentally believe that you can heal - actually heal - no matter how impossible that sounds or what you have lived through. I will hold that hope until you believe it too. Reach out and let's see if I'm a good therapeutic fit for you!"
